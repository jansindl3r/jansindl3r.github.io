Rotor started as exploration of then freshly introduced variable font format. It presents an unconventional axis — rotation. As its name the font can be read from both sides. Rotor is also a story of developing backend tools that helped me with production. Thanks to studies at [Type and Media](https://typemedia.org/), [KABK](https://www.kabk.nl/) I was able to automatize most of my workflow. What had to be done by hand in past is now fully automatized. I am planning to implement new axes to make rotor a bit more flexible and animatable. Those axes will be depth, weight, monospaceness & metrics at 90° (either if the glyph keeps the same width during rotation or if it adjusts).
