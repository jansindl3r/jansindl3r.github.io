Integra started during my studies at UMPRUM. Redesign of the classic Futura with additional script style that was design much later after Renner's Futura, exactly in Edwin W. Shaar in 1954. This interesting, yet undiscovered curiosity fascinated me. Putting it together into a bunch called Integra.

The Grotesque and Oblique styles were closely following its original. 

The Script styles became more related to what its other family members.
