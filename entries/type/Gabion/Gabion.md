Gabion explores links between headline and text styles. It is a result of very important learning process. Process of unconnectable dots, searching and learning and changing opinion every day and week. In the end I had a typeface that I would had never thought of drawing because it used to be out of my comfort zone. Now I see new fields to explore and have experiences and material to build on.

*First sketches were all about exploration of writing tools, combining styles and seeing what could have been done*

I had some ideas on how to use Gabion as well I did have some design trying Gabion in different situations. I was curious how others will Gabion find like. How would they use it? What topic will they chose it for? And how will I feel about their designs? I sent it to few friends and I was happy with all of the reponses, though here are my two most favourite.

*And [So-Hyun](http://baesohyun.com/)'s poster for a fictional event in Berlin shows great capability of So-Hyun as a designer while putting Gabion in a good light. Thanks!*
