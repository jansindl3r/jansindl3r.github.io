Gabion explores links between headline and text styles. It is a result of very important learning process. Process of unconnectable dots, searching and learning and changing opinion every day and week. In the end I had a typeface that I would had never thought of drawing because it used to be out of my comfort zone. Now I see new fields to explore and have experiences and material to build on.
