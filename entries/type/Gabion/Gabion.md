Gabion explores connections between headline and text styles. It is a result of very important learning process. Process of inconnectable dots, searching, learning and changing opinion every day and week. After that all I have a typeface that I would had never thought of drawing. Now I see new fields to explore and have experiences, material and thoughts to build on.

*First sketches were all about exploration of writing tools, combining styles and seeing what could have been done*

As I learnt, doing quick digitizations and seeing results quickly is a very effective way how to design. The sketch below is one of such digital sketches. I liked the way I could modulate the shape as well as I was interested how designed details disappear in smaller sizes. This gave first direction to what Gabion Text is today.

*Sketch that gave put the first seed of Gabion in the ground and let it grow*

I had some ideas on how to use Gabion as well I did have some design trying Gabion in different situations. I was curious how others will Gabion find like. How would they use it? What topic will they chose it for? And how will I feel about their designs? I sent it to few friends and I was happy with all of the reponses, though here are my two most favourite.

*I love [Tor](https://www.instagram.com/tor.s.j/)'s design for a fictional architectural agency of my girlfriend.*

*And [So-Hyun](http://baesohyun.com/)'s poster for a fictional event in Berlin shows great capability of So-Hyun as a designer while putting Gabion in a good light. Thanks!*
