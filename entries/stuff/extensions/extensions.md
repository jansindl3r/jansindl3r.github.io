Extensions or digital tools are important part of my workflow. I tend to observe pattern or tiring task in my workflow which I then automatize.

### Extreeeme45
adds point at extrema point under 45 degrees on selected curves or the whole glyph. It was created out of the need for taking full advantage of the infamous diagonal stem in "S" and related problems.
