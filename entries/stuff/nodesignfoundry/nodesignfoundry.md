This is my personal project. A "type foundry" with that has no typefaces. It offers various filters that you can apply on your existing fonts, aiming to reuse and refresh them. It aims to be open sources and collaborative, meaning I am planning to invite others to join this project. (it's still in progress)

Thanks to all who maintain the libraries used in this project.
