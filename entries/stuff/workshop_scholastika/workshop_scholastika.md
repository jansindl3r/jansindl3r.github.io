On 9th November 2020 I gave a workshop for a Graphic Design class at Prague school [Scholastika](https://scholastika.cz/). We went through basics of type and font production. We had a look first on interpolations and tasted a bit of interpolations of higher order. I showed background of font production like rotor. This lecture was followed by a short [typecooker](http://typecooker.com/) session and discussion about the student's work.
