During my internship at LucasFonts I heard the magic spell _VTT_ many times, I did not really know what it meant but it sounded cool and I wanted to learn about. Early naive explorations only led to dissapointment and being confused. I wanted to give it another chance, so I chose hinting in VTT as topic of my bachelor work. 

Fortunatelly, thanks to missing resources online I was able to get in touch with Mike Duggan who later became big help for my project and also came as my consultant to Prague for my presentations. I learnt about all possible approaches, how a good point structere can help and how to handle such incompatible workflow. 

Back then I created my first Python tool that allowed updating glyph order of in-progress VTT file to a new order of a freshly exported TTF file.
