During my internship at LucasFonts I heard the magic spell _VTT_ many times, I did not really know but it sounded cool and I wanted to learn about. Naive exploration without any basic knowledge of TT hinting only led to dissapointment. I wanted to give it another chance so I chose hinting in VTT as topic of my bachelor work. Fortunatelly thanks to missing resources online I was able to get in touch with Mike Duggan who later became big help for my project and also came as my consultant to Prague for my presentations.
